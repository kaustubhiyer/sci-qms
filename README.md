# Overview

This project is something I'm building on the side to manage quotations for my dad's fabrication firm. The current plan is to have a server-webapp hosted locally, with a forward looking future of self-hosting it on a raspberry pi and tunneling the url out.

# Tech

I want to use this project as an opportunity to explore new tech, so I'm looking into using something like svelte or a newer framework, just to see how it feels.

In terms of the backend, I haven't worked much with Go or Rust or Zig, and though I'm leaning towards Go or Zig, I'll still need to evaluate what I would personally like to learn the most.
